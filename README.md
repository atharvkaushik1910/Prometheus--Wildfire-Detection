# Prometheus-Wildfire-Detection: Verifiable AI (Sample Code)

This repository contains sample code that illustrates the core technical components of **Project Prometheus**, a proposed initiative focused on the development of a **verifiable AI-based wildfire early detection and parametric finance system**. This repository is intended to serve as a reference implementation and blueprint for the initial three-month pilot phase in **British Columbia, Canada**, with the objective of future expansion across North America.

---

## Project Description

Project Prometheus leverages the capabilities of the **Observatory Protocol (OP)**—a framework that combines **verifiable artificial intelligence**, **decentralized data infrastructures**, and **blockchain-enabled governance mechanisms**. The primary objective is to build a trustless, transparent, and scalable platform for wildfire risk mitigation and financial response.

This repository provides an overview of:

- **Data Ingestion and Pre-processing**: Techniques for preparing meteorological and environmental data.
- **AI Model Architecture**: A sample machine learning model designed for wildfire ignition prediction.
- **Verifiable Computation**: A conceptual demonstration of cryptographic integrity techniques foundational to verifiable inference.
